  abstract = {Background
Colletotrichum is one of the most widespread and important genus of plant pathogenic fungi worldwide. Various species of Colletotrichum are the causative agents of anthracnose disease in plants, which is a severe problem to agricultural crops particularly in Thailand. These phytopathogens are usually controlled using chemicals; however, the use of these agents can lead to environmental pollution. Potential non-chemical control strategies for anthracnose disease include the use of bacteria capable of producing anti-fungal compounds such as actinomycetes spp., that comprise a large group of filamentous, Gram positive bacteria from soil. The aim of this study was to isolate actinomycetes capable of inhibiting the growth of Colletotrichum spp, and to analyze the diversity of actinomycetes from plant rhizospheric soil.

Results
A total of 304 actinomycetes were isolated and tested for their inhibitory activity against Colletotrichum gloeosporioides strains DoA d0762 and DoA c1060 and Colletotrichum capsici strain DoA c1511 which cause anthracnose disease as well as the non-pathogenic Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain IFO 10217. Most isolates (222 out of 304, 73.0\%) were active against at least one indicator fungus or yeast. Fifty four (17.8\%) were active against three anthracnose fungi and 17 (5.6\%) could inhibit the growth of all three fungi and S. cerevisiae used in the test. Detailed analysis on 30 selected isolates from an orchard at Chanthaburi using the comparison of 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that most of the isolates (87\%) belong to the genus Streptomyces sp., while one each belongs to Saccharopolyspora (strain SB-2) and Nocardiopsis (strain CM-2) and two to Nocardia (strains BP-3 and LK-1). Strains LC-1, LC-4, JF-1, SC-1 and MG-1 exerted high inhibitory activity against all three anthracnose fungi and yeast. In addition, the organic solvent extracts prepared from these five strains inhibited conidial growth of the three indicator fungi. Preliminary analysis of crude extracts by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) indicated that the sample from strain JF-1 may contain a novel compound. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that this strain is closely related to Streptomyces cavurensis NRRL 2740 with 99.8\% DNA homology of 16S rRNA gene (500 bp).

Conclusion
The present study suggests that rhizospheric soil is an attractive source for the discovery of a large number of actinomycetes with activity against Colletotrichum spp. An interesting strain (JF-1) with high inhibitory activity has the potential to produce a new compound that may be useful in the control of Colletotrichum spp.},

Introduced into the soil by seed dressing or soil treatment, the microbe secretes antibiotic substances which inhibit many seed and soil-borne fungal pathogens. The biofungicide developed by Kemira Oy is produced by fermentation. It is a powder consisting of mycelium, spores and formulation additives. The number of colony forming units in the final product is 108-9/1 g. Promising results have been achieved with Mycostop on several greenhouse and field crops against many pathogens, especially Fusarium sp. In this paper only the tests carried out with carnation, cauliflower, sweet pepper and wheat are presented. The efficacy of Mycostop has been proved against damping-off on many vegetables and ornamentals by using seed dressing. Good protection against carnation wilt caused by Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. dianthi has been achieved by root dipping and soil spraying with Mycostop. Other important control targets, so far, are root diseases on cucumber, grey mould on lettuce and seedling and head blight on wheat caused by Fusarium culmorum.},

  abstract = {Actinomycetes are known for their secondary metabolites, which have been successfully used as drugs in human and veterinary medicines. However, information on the distribution of this group of Gram-positive bacteria in diverse ecosystems and a comprehension of their activities in ecosystem processes are still scarce. We have developed a 16S rRNA-based taxonomic microarray that targets key actinomycetes at the genus level. In total, 113 actinomycete 16S rRNA probes, corresponding to 55 of the 202 described genera, were designed. The microarray accuracy was evaluated by comparing signal intensities with probe/target-weighted mismatch values and the Gibbs energy of the probe/target duplex formation by hybridizing 17 non-actinomycete and 29 actinomycete strains/clones with the probe set. The validation proved that the probe set was specific, with only 1.3\% of false results. The incomplete coverage of actinomycetes by a genus-specific probe was caused by the limited number of 16S rRNA gene sequences in databases or insufficient 16S rRNA gene polymorphism. The microarray enabled discrimination between actinomycete communities from three forest soil samples collected at one site. Cloning and sequencing of 16S rRNA genes from one of the soil samples confirmed the microarray results. We propose that this newly constructed microarray will be a valuable tool for genus-level comparisons of actinomycete communities in various ecological conditions.},

  abstract = {The main objective of the present study was to isolate and characterize actinomycetes for their plant growth-promotion in chickpea. A total of 89 actinomycetes were screened for their antagonism against fungal pathogens of chickpea by dual culture and metabolite production assays. Four most promising actinomycetes were evaluated for their physiological and plant growth-promotion properties under in vitro and in vivo conditions. All the isolates exhibited good growth at temperatures from 20 Â°C to 40 Â°C, pH range of 7â11 and NaCl concentrations up to 8\%. These were also found highly tolerant to Bavistin, slightly tolerant to Thiram and Captan (except VAI-7 and VAI-40) but susceptible to Benlate and Ridomil at field application levels and were found to produce siderophore, cellulase, lipase, protease, chitinase (except VAI-40), hydrocyanic acid (except VAI-7 and VAI-40), indole acetic acid and Î²-1,3-glucanase. When the four actinomycetes were evaluated for their plant growth-promotion properties under field conditions on chickpea, all exhibited increase in nodule number, shoot weight and yield. The actinomycetes treated plots enhanced total N, available P and organic C over the un-inoculated control. The scanning electron microscope studies exhibited extensive colonization by actinomycetes on the root surface of chickpea. The expression profiles for indole acetic acid, siderophore and Î²-1,3-glucanase genes exhibited up-regulation for all three traits and in all four isolates. The actinomycetes were identified as Streptomyces but different species in the 16S rDNA analysis. It was concluded that the selected actinomycetes have good plant growth-promotion and biocontrol potentials on chickpea.},

  abstract   = {Comparative analysis of molecular sequence data is essential for reconstructing the evolutionary histories of species and inferring the nature and extent of selective forces shaping the evolution of genes and species. Here, we announce the release of Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis version 5 (MEGA5), which is a user-friendly software for mining online databases, building sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees, and using methods of evolutionary bioinformatics in basic biology, biomedicine, and evolution. The newest addition in MEGA5 is a collection of maximum likelihood (ML) analyses for inferring evolutionary trees, selecting best-fit substitution models (nucleotide or amino acid), inferring ancestral states and sequences (along with probabilities), and estimating evolutionary rates site-by-site. In computer simulation analyses, ML tree inference algorithms in MEGA5 compared favorably with other software packages in terms of computational efficiency and the accuracy of the estimates of phylogenetic trees, substitution parameters, and rate variation among sites. The MEGA user interface has now been enhanced to be activity driven to make it easier for the use of both beginners and experienced scientists. This version of MEGA is intended for the Windows platform, and it has been configured for effective use on Mac OS X and Linux desktops. It is available free of charge from http://www.megasoftware.net.},

  abstract   = {Three actinomycetes isolates were isolated from empty fruit bunch (EFB) compost of oil palm. They were identified as Nocardiopsis sp. (ac9), Streptomyces violaceorubidus (6ca11) and Streptomyces sp. (ac19). The enzymatic potential of the three isolates were established from assays on hydrolytic and lignolytic activities. The production of amylases, cellulases and xylanases were higher in isolates Nocardiopsis sp. (ac9) and S. violaceorubidus (6ca11), at both mesophilic (40Â±2Â°C) and thermophilic (60Â±2Â°C) temperatures. On the contrary, lignolytic activities were higher at mesophilic temperature. Streptomyces sp. (ac19) showed higher lignolytic activities at both temperatures compared to the other two isolates. These three isolates were also antagonistic towards the pathogenic Ganoderma boninense. Nocardiopsis sp. (ac9) was superior with 91.4\% inhibition. From this study, it is established that indigenous actinomycetes isolates have both enzymatic and antagonistic potential for use in composting and Ganoderma control, respectively. We recommend the application of actinomycetes into the compost heap during mesophilic stages to allow progressive composting and for compost to be enriched with actinomycetes.},
